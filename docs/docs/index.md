# About

This project uses LTSP, Proxmox, LDAP and Apache Guacamole to deploy a fully functioning training center webapp, where users/students can access a linux OS through the convenience of their web browser.

The administrator can manage users through LDAP including creation of users, setting password, disabling as well as allocating a VM to a user. Using LDAP means the authentication for WebApp login as well as the OS can be managed from a single place
